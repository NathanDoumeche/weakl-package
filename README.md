# WeaKL

**WeaKL** is a Python package for constructing **kernel methods** with **weak physical information** as introduced in the paper  
[**Forecasting time series with constraints**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10485) (2025) by Nathan Doumèche, Francis Bach, Eloi Bedek, Claire Boyer, Gérard Biau, and Yannig Goude.



##  Features

- Build kernels tailored to weak information
- Compatible with NumPy and PyTorch backends  
- GPU support via PyTorch for accelerated computation  

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install weakl
```
